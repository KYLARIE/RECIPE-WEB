            <h1>EMPANADA</h1>
            <p>An empanada is a stuffed bread or pastry baked or fried in many countries of Latin America and the south of Europe. The name comes from the
              verb empanar, meaning to wrap or coat in bread. Empanada is made by folding a dough or bread patty around the stuffing. The stuffing can consist of a variety of meats, vegetables, or even fruits.

Whisk the egg yolk and water together in a small bowl until smooth; pour into the well and mix to form a stiff dough.

            <h1>CHEESECAKE</h1>
            <p>Cheesecake, a dessert consisting of a thick, creamy filling of cheese, eggs, and sugar over a thinner crust and topped with sweet or sometimes salty items. North American variations of cheesecake, including the type known as New York style, use cream cheese in the filling and a crispy crust made from graham cracker or cookie crumbs. Typical toppings include sour cream, fruit sauces, chocolate or caramel syrup, nuts, whipped cream, or pieces of fruit. </p>

A digital thermometer inserted into the filling 1" from the edge should read between 165°F and 170°F; the filling won't look entirely set in the center.</td>
